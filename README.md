## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have 10+ years of engineering expertise in Distributed System, Database,
Blockchain, Crypto, Networking, Data Security, Content Protection, and Viedo
Encoding

I strive to write neat, efficient, well-structured, and bug-free production
code. I am also very entheusiastic at performance optimization. Check this 
example: https://github.com/dustinxie/lockfree

My recent interests are focused on blockchain and crypto. Check these repos
for some of my recent work:
- https://github.com/dustinxie/ecc (native secp256k1 elliptic curve implementation)
- https://github.com/iotexproject/iotex-core (primary repo of the IoTeX blockchain)
- https://github.com/iotexproject/pharos (gRPC â†’ HTTP gateway service)
- https://github.com/iotexproject/iotex-antenna-go (golang SDK of IoTeX blockchain)
- https://github.com/trustwallet/wallet-core (integration with TrustWallet App)

I take ownership for my work and enjoy a teamwork environment. And I am always
passionate to learn new technology and do knowledge sharing with teammates.
